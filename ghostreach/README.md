# GhostReach Daemon

This repository contains the core modules for GhostReach, an autonomous dark-funnel lead harvesting and outreach daemon.  The system automatically discovers hidden leads on the web, stores them in a local vault, and executes outbound email campaigns.

## Components

### `lead_harvester.py`
Responsible for crawling hidden or unlisted SaaS sign‑ups, admin panels, and forms behind login walls.  It uses a browser automation library to emulate user sessions and extract high‑value lead data such as email addresses, names, roles, and usage signals.  This module should be extended to include logic for handling authentication and session persistence.

### `vault_manager.py`
A simple SQLite‑based vault for storing harvested leads.  It exposes methods to insert new leads, fetch leads by status, and update lead processing states.  The vault ensures deduplication and provides a clean interface for downstream tasks.

### `ghost_outreach.py`
Handles sending personalized outreach emails to harvested leads.  It uses a configurable SMTP or email API provider (e.g., Mailgun, Postmark) and automatically tracks opens, clicks, and replies.  The module also supports templated email generation based on market_targets.json.

### `market_targets.json`
A sample JSON configuration file that defines target industries, buyer personas, and email template variants.  You can customize this file to point the daemon toward specific market verticals.

## Usage

These modules are intended to be integrated into a larger daemon system with scheduled tasks.  As a starting point, you can run `lead_harvester.py` to collect leads, then `ghost_outreach.py` to perform outreach once new leads are loaded into the vault.

## Disclaimer

This code is provided as a skeletal framework for demonstration purposes.  You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations when collecting and using personal data.  Harvesting leads from unauthorized sources and sending unsolicited email may be illegal and unethical.
